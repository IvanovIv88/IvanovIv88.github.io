                        <h2>TRAVEL TO CUBA: A GUIDE TO THE COUNTRY’S FRUSTRATIONS AND FASCINATIONS</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>Travel to Cuba is every sound and shade of Caribbean beautiful on the surface – famed for its world-class cigars, infectious street music, vintage Cadillacs and pastel-hued decaying mansions. Beneath that, it’s an island unlike its neighbours – fractured by Communist rule and archaic social systems that makes travelling here frustrating.</p>
                    <p>A source of fascination and media frenzy that was once only accessible to outsiders via its paradise beach hubs and neighbouring cities, travel to Cuba has been open to wider exploration for quite some time. Independent travel in Cuba, away from cruise ship excursions and resort holidays, isn’t at all easy, but worth the challenge if you are curious enough to dig deeper. It’s one of the most captivating places you will ever visit, and deemed the most fascinating of all the Caribbean. Cuba is a country whose slow climb to normality is what many foreign visitors inadvertently come to see. Its people are welcoming and will greet you with a smile, yet most are struggling. The retro cars and crumbling buildings may be kitsch and step-back-in-time, but they are a reminder of the thwarted growth of the country. This is just some of the many contradictions you will face while travelling here. Beyond the usual Introduction to the Cuba travel circuit of Havana, Viñales and Varadero, I spent a month travelling further afield with two friends, venturing beyond to Matanzas, Santa Clara, Remedios, Cienfuegos, Trinidad, Camagüey, Santiago De Cuba, Sancti Spiritus and Baracoa.</p>
                    <p>We were a team on a mission to uncover Cuba and its multi-layered landscapes and regions, knowing full well it wasn’t going to always be easy. It’s hard to put into words the things we saw and the things we heard. It was hard work to even find out information needed to get a clearer picture. The things we loved, and loathed and found confusing. The things which were heartbreaking to see. The first-hand lessons of history, found in every town and city and quiet street corner, those of which summon almost daily debates over dinner about what aspects of this communist society work… and those that don’t. Travel to Cuba soon shatters a lot of dreams. Cuba is huge – its 15 provinces span over 110,000 square kilometres and getting from one end to the other of this long island is a journey of over 1,100 kilometres! Destinations may look close to one another on a map, but can take many more hours than imagined. Getting from A to B isn’t always simple – you can’t plan your days according to rigid timetables.</p>
                    <p>Roughly plan where you want to go on a map that you can keep with you. Highlight the places you want to visit and start planning your first two or three stops. It’s hard to plan beyond that, since you can’t always get the bus tickets where and when you want. A map will be useful for when you need to switch routes and see where the next nearest city is, or the next best place to pick up a bus or a shared taxi.</p>
