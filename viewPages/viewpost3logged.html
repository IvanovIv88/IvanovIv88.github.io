                        <h2>AUSTRALIA ROAD TRIP PLAN – CITY, COASTLINE & CONSERVATION IN VICTORIA</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>My Australia road trip in Victoria wouldn’t have been the same without digging deep into its capital, Melbourne. One of the world’s ‘most livable cities’, it sprung from the gold rush in the mid 1800’s, where today a scattering of colonial architectural pokes through as a window of its short history.</p>
                    <p>It is compact and easily navigable, but heavy on the cultural and activity spectrum – sports and entertainment venues in droves, riverside cool and eclectic neighbourhoods, quirky fast food outlets and gourmet restaurants, gritty laneways and glistening towers. I (traditionally) met a friend under the clocks at Flinders station and dined on the riverfront, dabbled in an art exhibition, devoured an infamous Melbourne breakfast or two at swanky eateries like Cumulus, and found all manner of boutique stores, hidden bars (including the Gin Palace) and ultra-cool hipster cafés.</p>
                    <p>Much of Melbourne’s highlights and best-kept secrets are concealed down historical arcades and laneways – the signature of Melbourne’s unique culture. Without a local in tow, you might just miss the best of what the city has to offer. I spent three hours on a Melbourne ‘Hidden Secrets’ tour – the city’s original laneway touring company, uncovering a side to Melbourne that is hidden from first glance. I was able to find the best architectural elements, wander local design and concept stores, meander historically rich and opulent arcades, and indulge in local hangouts that gave insight into artistic focus of the city. The afternoon was dedicated to learning more about the art movement in the city’s old laneways with Blender Studios and their Melbourne Street Tours.</p>
                    <p>The Melbourne Street Art movement burst into life around 2001, and now includes everything from huge graffiti works, throw-ups, stencils, paste-ups and lanes covered in everything from re-purposed junk and bat-winged Barbie dolls. It’s here you will also get to witness the Rooftop Honey project in action – where hives have been placed on roof spaces of cafes, restaurants and hotels in and around Melbourne for bee conservation whilst creating delicious honey. Artists from Blender Studios, such as my guide Junky, teach you all about the urban movement here while taking you to the best artworks and the most famous of lanes including ‘Hosier’ and ‘Blender’, where you get to meet the artists back at the studio, on the lane that contains some of the city’s earliest murals and designs. While Melbourne is easily connected outside of the Central Business District (CBD), especially with its well-known tramlines connecting you to characteristic neighbourhoods such as including St. Kilda, Richmond and Fitzroy, there’s only one way to see it in its entirety. Melbourne is one of the few cities in the world where permission is granted for hot air balloon rides to glide all across the city. Your day might start at 4am in preparation to catch the breaking of dawn, but you will get to see Melbourne from all angles, from its outer boroughs until the CBD and its adjacent coastal edges.</p>
                    <p>In Victoria, indulgence is mixed with education and conservation. On the way to the epicentre of vineyard fun, I stopped at the Yarra Valley’s beautiful bush land of the Healesville Sanctuary wildlife conservation park. This education, breeding and sanctuary haven is carved out on indigenous land, and has become a place that has helped to fight the near-extinction of many species of animals through breeding and rehabilitation. Here you can see over 200 species of Australian animals including koalas, wombats, dingoes, platypus, pelicans, emus and possums in a natural environment, and see its wildlife hospital in action, where more than 2000 sick orphaned and injured native animals are cared for each year and brought back to life. I guarantee seeing a tiny possum being fed will be one of the cutest things you will ever see. Or a wombat munching on pumpkin. You decide.</p>
