                        <h2>THE COMPACT CITY OF BERN – SWITZERLAND’S CAPITAL OF SURPRISES</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>Bern has been Switzerland’s federal capital since 1848. But what if everything you pictured a capital city to be turned out to be the complete opposite? Many assume Zürich to be the capital of Switzerland, so the slower-paced and compact Bern is quite the surprise.</p>
                    <p>Travel to Bern certainly changes perceptions on what a capital city should be, or what it is typically deemed to be. Absent are high-rises and a financial centre; bustling crowds and dense populations that fill miles of distinct districts that hug an old central, historical pocket. The Old Town of Bern was declared a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 1983 because of the preserved medieval city centre.</p>
                    <p>It’s also home to the first Lindt chocolate factory, legends of bears (and real bears) and Einstein’s most famous published work. It can also tune up a gear with some more adventurous action; including following the locals who have made urban swimming an actual UNESCO listed Swiss tradition. Bern’s placement in the very centre of the country means it holds true to its capital reign in being the heart of the country and also in being a jumping board from which to explore wider Switzerland. Naturally, any visitor will begin exploring right in the heart of Bern – in the historical old town.</p>
                    <p>It’s island like layout woven together by the bending Aare River, is best explored by foot (although trams do connect one end of the city to the other and to the outer neighbourhoods). The Zytglogge (Clock Tower) is the darling of the city – an historical highlight and one of the most favoured ‘meeting spots’. I passed this dozens of times, emerging from side streets and arcades, or simply by circling the city as I explored. Tours take place inside the clock where you can see the history of it, and view its mechanical workings. It’s otherworldly in its old, creaking, hidden loft-like dwelling, and has large windows that open out onto the city for a closer, and more exclusive perspective. The four miles of covered stores that form arching waves within the baroque buildings are not just on the surface though. More intriguing for me, were the shops underground, whose small wooden slat doors are open on the street for those who want to venture down into cave-like cool dwellings, housing all manner of boutiques, bars and cafes. The medieval streets and narrow side alleys weave you typical old town highlights of Bern, including a smattering of churches, a Town Hall and an opulent mint and gold-topped parliament building. Ghost walks take place in the old medieval alleyways at night for an alternative look at the city’s history.</p>
